# Installing
Clone the repository to your project directory.

Then, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

After dependencies are installed, run `npm build` to generate compiled files.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the server. Visit `localhost:5001` to see the index page (Page List).


## Configuring the Api Url
In the `.env` file in the base directory, set `API_URL=yourdomain.com` in order to use a custom API location. Defaults to `localhost:8080`.
